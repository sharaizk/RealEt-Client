        The foundation for RealET was laid after conducting thorough research of
        the dynamics of the real estate industry in Pakistan. The goal was to
        develop a product that provided safe and transparent property
        transactions and result-oriented profitable deals. And hence real-et.me
        was created for every Pakistani who wants to buy, sell, rent, or develop
        property.
